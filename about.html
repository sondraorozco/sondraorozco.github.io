          <h3 class="s-bio-heading">Learning to code</h3>
          <p>I built my very first website at the age of 12. The year was 1997, the movie <span style="font-style: italic;">Titanic</span> had just come out, and I wanted a place to store all my favorite photos of the actor Leonardo DiCaprio, so I built a fan site. At the time, my mom had been teaching herself HTML by looking at the source code of websites and writing down in a little notebook what HTML tags were necessary to produce different layouts and elements. I built my first website using my mom’s notebook as a guide. Unfortunately, my 1997 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities">GeoCities</a> website is no longer running, so I couldn’t add it to this portfolio. &#x1F643 </p>

          <p>In college I took an intro to Java course while I was an undergrad at MIT, and discovered that I loved coding. I didn’t pursue software engineering as a career, but I continued to dabble in coding. I scripted with Ruby to build simple web crawlers, I became proficient in SQL while working as a data analyst, and I’ve built several Wordpress websites with custom themes. I’ve always known enough about code to be able to hack things together, but I’ve never had the full end-to-end set of skills to build an app or website completely from scratch. I’m thrilled to be taking this MIT xPro course to learn just that.</p>

          <h3 class="s-bio-heading">Career</h3>
          <p>I’ve been working in tech for 15 years, and I’ve been a Product Manager for the last 10. I’ve had the opportunity to work at incredible companies including Google, Looker, and Upwork. My experience ranges from pre-series A startup to FAANG company, from B2B enterprise SaaS products to B2C mobile apps. As a product manager, I work closely with engineers every day to make sure that my teams are building the right products to delight our customers. Learning full stack development will make me an even better partner to the engineering teams I work with, especially as I continue to focus my PM career on technical products and features in the infrastructure space.</p>

          <p>Outside of work and school I spend most of my free time tinkering on entrepreneurial ideas with my husband and raising our Golden Retriever puppy, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mandomymando/">Mando</a>. My husband and I love to travel. We spent the first 2 years of our marriage traveling around the world as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad">digital nomads</a>—we worked remotely (long before that became a global work trend) while visiting 15 countries and 5 US states. Now we’re settled down in the suburbs of Sacramento, California, where we are enjoying the delicious local food scene and lots of beautiful nearby hikes.</p>
