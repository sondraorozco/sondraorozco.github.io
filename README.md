I couldn't have made this site without the help of Bootstrap tutorials on the [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sosXZsdy-s) YouTube channel and responsive CSS techniques I read about on [*CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/look-ma-no-media-queries-responsive-layouts-using-css-grid/).

Also the open source illustrations from [unDraw](https://undraw.co/) are awesome.

## roadmap: planned future improvements
- [ ] improve how images render on mobile devices
- [ ] add more projects to the portfolio!
- [ ] add a contact form
- [ ] put this site on a custom domain
